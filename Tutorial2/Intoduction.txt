Frameworks like Rails and Sinatra are Rack Based.

Rack powers web Applications = Its a HTTP parser which sits b/w ur Web application(Rails/Sinatra/Camping) and the web server that runs ur application.


Rack listens to request coming in over TCP/IP , parsing the values and then handing it to our application.


What Rack Provides
------------------
Rack does a lot more then lower level operations like parsing HTTP.
It also exposes powerfull API, so that u include Rack module as needed.

Things like:

Request
Response
URLMap
Session
Logging
Authentication
Cookies
Exceptions 


In a Rack Application you have to implement one single method call , accepting single argument of environment.
